# hello-world

Hi Coders,

I am Ardit and I like coding especially with Java. I'm new to GitHub platform, so I'm trying to
follow to Hubot what is commanding me to do hahahha, but not for to long because I know I can rely on myself.

Except[(ion) not java's one] Java, I'm learning HTML5 & CSS3 and for to short I will begin with JavaScript.
